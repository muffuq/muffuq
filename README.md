Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am a young developer from <img width="20" height="20" align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/ff547ZT.png%22%3E Turkey. At the age of 14, I became interested in software and continued learning as a hobby. I am now 18 years old and I continue my career as a front-end developer.

The passion of programming started as a hobby at a young age and now I am always trying to improve my skills, always learning new things in my free times. I am more focused on web development since the latest years and I am trying to learn more about them.
